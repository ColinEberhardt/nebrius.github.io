    <p>i'm a node.js developer and technical evangelist at microsoft.</p>
    <p>you may be asking yourself, "what is a technical evangelist?" it's a valid question, i didn't even know the answer myself until somewhat recently. there is a formal definition that involves words like "engagement," "community," and "growth." at least i would imagine there is a formal definition involving those words, i actually don't know for certain. but let's forget about that for now. instead, i like to think that my job as a technical evangelist is to create warm fuzzy feelings in developers about microsoft and our products.</p>
    <p>i like warm fuzzy feelings, and i like it when other people have warm fuzzy feelings too. they're so much better than cold hard feelings.</p>
    <p>don't you think?</p>
    <p>you would be forgiven for thinking this sounds an awful lot like sales. or maybe marketing. and it does combine elements of both of these, but that undersells both evangelism and sales/marketing.</p>
    <p>but enough about what evangelism is or is not like, let's talk about what it is. i do things like speaking at conferences and meetups, running workshops, blogging, doing lots of open source work, and creating fun demos.</p>
    <p>-</p>
    public speaking you say?
    <p>-</p>
    so about that whole open source thing
    <p>-</p>
    <p>this is what i look like</p>
